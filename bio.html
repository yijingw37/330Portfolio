            Hello, my name is Yijing.
            <br>
            I am a Computer Science Master's student at Northwestern University since September 2021.
            <br>
            I did my undergrad at the University of Auckland in New Zealand.
            <br>
            I spent the past twelve years in New Zealand.
            <br>
            I decided to come to the United States of America to pursue new opportunities.
            <br>
            My focus is software engineering.
            <br>
            I graduate in March 2023.
            <br>
            I am currently looking for full time software engineer opportunities in 2023.
            <br>
            When I'm not coding, I am trying new recipes and exploring nature.
            <br>
