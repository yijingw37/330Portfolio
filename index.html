            <p>
                This is a VR project that offers users a virtual hangout space with their friends when they couldn't go out. 
                My space offers a refuge in the sense that I created a peaceful social space surrounded by cute puppy pictures like a gallery. People can hide behind the puppy photos if they don't want to be seen. 
                My space also offers a prospect in the sense that there is an open area for socializing and there is chat pet and cheese plate in the open area for people to watch or play with.

            <p>
                This is a VR project that offers users a virtual third place. 
                My starting idea is to have a pink universe for people to hang out. I tried to build a world with a couple pink planets in it, and a puppy.
                I want my guests to feel relaxed. I also added an audio of nature as background music.
                My room has mystery and enticement. The planets and rainbow in my room are the mystery items that you don't see in everyday life and contribute to the mysterious atmosphere in the room.
